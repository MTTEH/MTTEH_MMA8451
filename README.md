# MTTEH_MMA8451
Arduino MMA8451 Co-Library for MTTEH Project

Incomming transmission :

It's funny, when I made this Co-Lib, I didn't knowing that C++ classes needed that function or method declared outside of classes needed the Scope...
Now I can have multiple inits function in the same file (Under Scopes), so it's not needed anymore to separate lib...
Now this lib is useless for main project, but will stay alive ! As archived project...

I would like prefer to separate my files inside the Arduino lib, but... And making a new lib for that is.... You know, right ?
